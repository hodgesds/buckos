    <h1>About Buckos</h1>

<section>
    <h2>What is Buckos?</h2>
    <p>Buckos (from the Greek word for "iron") is a modern Linux distribution built entirely in Rust. Our goal is to create a fast, secure, and highly configurable operating system that takes the best ideas from existing distributions while providing a clean, modern implementation.</p>

    <p>The name "Iron Works" reflects our commitment to building robust, industrial-strength system software that can be relied upon for production use.</p>

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>

    <h3>Modern Foundation</h3>
    <p>We believe system software should take advantage of modern programming language features. Rust provides memory safety guarantees, fearless concurrency, and excellent performance - all crucial for core system components.</p>

    <h3>User Control</h3>
    <p>Like Gentoo, Buckos is source-based and gives users fine-grained control over their systems. USE flags let you enable exactly the features you need, while the package manager handles complex dependency resolution.</p>

    <h3>Simplicity</h3>
    <p>While powerful, Buckos strives for simplicity in its implementation. Clean code is easier to audit, maintain, and contribute to. We avoid unnecessary complexity and legacy baggage.</p>

    <h3>Transparency</h3>
    <p>Buckos is fully open source under the Apache-2.0 license. We believe in transparent development and welcome community involvement at all levels.</p>

    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>Buckos draws inspiration from several sources:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gentoo Linux:</strong> Package management concepts, USE flags, slots, and the Portage system</li>
        <li><strong>Rust Ecosystem:</strong> Modern systems programming practices and tooling</li>
        <li><strong>Unix Philosophy:</strong> Simple, composable tools that do one thing well</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>Project Status</h2>
    <p>Buckos is currently in active development. Core components are being built out:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Component</th>
                <th>Status</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Package Manager</td>
                <td>In Development</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Init System</td>
                <td>In Development</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Configuration System</td>
                <td>In Development</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Package Repository</td>
                <td>Planned</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Installation Media</td>
                <td>Planned</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>We're building the foundation first - the tools needed to build and manage a complete system. Once these are solid, we'll focus on creating installation media and a package repository.</p>
